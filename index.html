    <li>Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge: press Ctrl+Shift+P on your keyboard and return to this website in an InPrivate window.</li>
    <li>Safari on iOS: Tap the tabs button (looks like <img src="./images/ios9-pages-icon.png" alt="ios9-pages-icon.png" height="16" width="16">) and tap Private. The top of this tab should be in a dark grey color, instead of white.</li>
  </ul>
